<p>The MoJ Cloud Platform is a modern hosting platform for digital services:</p>

<ul>
<li>It makes it quick and easy to &lsquo;just deploy an app&rsquo;</li>
<li>Teams get the features they need to operate their service, such as
easy scalability, zero downtime deploys, security scanning,
monitoring, logging, and more, all setup for you by default</li>
<li>When you need the full power of AWS or Kubernetes, it&rsquo;s all available</li>
<li>Configuration is all self-service, using Infrastructure as Code with
managed CI/CD and GitOps processes</li>
<li>The Cloud Platform team manage the hosting and provide support for
the platform</li>
</ul>
